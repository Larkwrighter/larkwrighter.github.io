title: "Mindfulness Teaching: Little Garden in the City"
description: "This unfinished project aimed to teach emotional self-care practices by combining relaxing farming sim gameplay with a thoughtful narrative.
<br /><br />
The experience was designed to be slow-paced and meditative, with players encouraged to take their time exploring the cosy garden location and getting to know the cast of positive characters who frequent it."
