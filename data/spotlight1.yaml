title: "Game-based RSE: Curious"
description: "I'm currently working with Curious, a new digital platform that uses a game-based approach to aid the delivery of relationships and sex education (RSE) in schools.
<br /><br />
My work has centred on designing mechanics and gameplay systems that are fun, engaging and accessible, but also communicate the subject material in a sensitive and appropriate way."
