              <p>Taking classic escape room gameplay, compressing it down to an uncomfortably small scale and mixing in a mind-bending narrative, The Subject is a truly unique experience for two or more players.</p>

                <h3>Description</h3>
                <p><b>The Subject</b> is an escape room experience like no other. The game is designed for multiple players; one player enters a small, cramped box, and is locked inside. The other player(s) must solve a series of puzzles to free their teammate. The twist? The information they need to solve the puzzles is on the inside of the box.
                </br></br>
                In the ultimate test of communication, concentration and calmness under pressure, players must work together to piece together a mysterious narrative, solve the puzzles, and free the subject from the box before their time is up...
                </br></br>
                The goal of the project is twofold: redefine what escape room games can be, and take them to a new level of intensity.
                </br></br>
                <h3>FAQs</h3>
                <p><b>Q. How long does the experience take to play?</b></p>
                <p>A. Players have a maximum time of 30 minutes to complete the game.</p>
                <p><b>Q. But what's the quickest a team has completed it?</b></p>
                <p>A. Just over 19 minutes.</p>
                <p><b>Q. Exactly how big is the box?</b></p>
                <p>The box is roughly 120cm long, 50cm wide and 70cm deep.</p>
                <p><b>Q. More importantly, is the box safe?</b></p>
                <p>Of course. The box was built with player safety in mind, and there are a number of safety procedures in place to ensure that any risks are mitigated.</p>
                <p>The box is well ventilated, and a light is provided as part of the experience. The player is able to communicate with those outside throughout the game. A gamemaster is always overseeing the experience whilst a player is inside the box, and they can signal to the gamemaster if they want to get out before the game is over.</p>
                <p>The box, whilst secure, is easy to dismantle in the event of a medical emergency. The use of pin hinge fasteners allow the box to be completely taken apart in seconds.</p>
                <p>A full and detailed risk assessment is available on request.</p>
                <p>Whilst the box is safe, participants who suffer from claustrophobia are advised to avoid entering the box as part of the experience.</p>
