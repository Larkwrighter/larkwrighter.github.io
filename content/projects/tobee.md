<b>To Bee or Not To Bee</b> is a VR experience about the importance of bees. Players are shrunk to the size of a bee, and must buzz their way around a garden environment, collecting nectar and pollinating flowers. As the game progresses a benevolent narrator teaches the player about bees and their importance to the everyday functions of the natural world.

The experience emphasises exploration, both of the gameworld but also an exploration of the player's own attitudes towards the natural world. It is relaxing to play and accessible to players who might not have a gaming background.

The game was created in six weeks by a team of five. The game was developed in Unity for the Oculus. I was responsible for game and narrative design.
