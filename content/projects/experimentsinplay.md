In 2019 I co-produced <b><a href="https://experimentsinplay.github.io/">Experiments in Play</a></b>, an exhibition showcasing inventive and experimental playful experiences that sit at the intersection of games, interactive design, and creative technology.

The show ran for three days, between 19-21 September, and included an opening night gala with a panel discussion on narrative in games.

The showcase pushed the bounds of what games can offer as a medium, experimenting with the vast capabilities of play. The breadth of work on show included physical performances and workshops, interactive literature, VR & AR experiences, alternative controllers, and playable works of art, as well as more traditional video game and board game experiences.

I was responsible for leading the setup at the venue, completing appropriate health and safety checks, liaising with participants about their work, and co-ordinating the marketing of the show.
