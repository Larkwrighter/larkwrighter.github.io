Put down new roots and become part of a close-knit community in <b>Little Garden in the City</b>, a meditative gardening sim. Envisioned as a slower-paced relative to Harvest Moon, the aim of this project was to pair simple farming sim gameplay mechanics with a cosy aesthetic to teach mindfulness and emotional self-care practices.

The game was designed to be a mindfulness activity in itself. Players were encouraged to play the game over weeks and months rather than in one sitting, taking a break from their day to check in and slowly cultivate their garden: tending to their plants, listening to relaxing music and catching up with the cast of positive characters who would share their stories on the garden's bulletin board.

<b>Little Garden in the City</b> is no longer in development, but an early demo of the game is available to play on itch.io. The game was worked developed by a <b>team of eight</b>. I was responsible for game and narrative design.
